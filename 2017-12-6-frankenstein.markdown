A few years ago--when I still thought I wanted to major in English literature--I decided to read *Frankenstein*. Apart from being vaguely interested in the story, I was drawn by the weird 19th century Romantic drama surrounding its inception. Long story short, Percy (22) meets Mary (17); Percy deserts his pregnant wife to party with Mary in continental Europe; Mary participates in a ghost story competition and writes *Frankenstein*; Percy edits and publishes *Frankenstein* before drowning in a lake.
