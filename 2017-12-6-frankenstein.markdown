A few years ago--when I still thought I wanted to major in English literature--I decided to read *Frankenstein*. Apart from being vaguely interested in the story, I was drawn by the weird 19th century Romantic drama surrounding its inception. Long story short: Boy (Percy, 23) meets girl (Mary, 18), deserts his pregnant wife to party with girl in continental Europe, girl participates in ghost story competition, writes *Frankenstein*, boy edits and publishes story before drowning in a lake.
