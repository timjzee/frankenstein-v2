# Introduction

A few years ago—when I still wanted to major in English literature—I decided to read *Frankenstein*. Apart from being vaguely interested in the story, I was mainly drawn to it because of the weird 19th century Romantic drama surrounding its inception. Long story short, Percy, a 22 year old poet, meets Mary, the 17 year old daughter of a prominent intellectual; Percy deserts his pregnant wife to party with Mary in continental Europe, where Mary participates in a ghost story competition and writes *Frankenstein*; Back in England, Percy edits and publishes *Frankenstein* before drowning off the coast of Italy.

Intrigued, I looked for an annotated edition of the novel that would provide additional details and context to the creation of Frankenstein. I quickly settled on this edition:

Interestingly, this edition contains two versions of the story: one version reprints the text of the first edition of the novel from 1818, and the other version was composed by the editor from handwritten drafts of *Frankenstein* that are held at the Oxford University library. However, the editor hadn't stopped there. He had marked Percy's contributions to this draft text in italics, using regular font for Mary's writing:

The editor, Charles E. Robinson, had based this annotation on a painstaking analysis of the different handwritings and types of ink that were used in the drafts.
These annotations definitely contributed to my reading experience, but after finishing the novel I quickly forgot about them. Last year, however, I was suddenly reminded of them when I was scrambling to find a topic for a course project. The course, which was called "Text mining", was about the application of computer algorithms (or to use another buzzword "machine learning") to 'mine' interesting information from text sources. The course had briefly touched on authorship attribution: feeding linguistic features of a text into computer algorithms to determine its author. I wondered whether it would be possible to use this method to arrive at an annotation of *Frankenstein* that was similar to the hand annotation by Robinson.

During my course project, I encountered a number of problems and questions. In this three part series of articles I'll describe how I eventually solved these problems (by building on other people's work) and found some interesting results.
It is worth noting that these articles are intended 'for dummies' and are definitely written by a dummy; I am by no means a computer programmer or literary scholar. However, these articles will be rather detailed. So buckle up for a long read or skip to the parts you find interesting.

# Getting a gold standard text

The first problem I encountered, and the topic of this first article, concerns getting a digital version of the hand annotated text by Robinson. This is more difficult than it may seem. Although an ebook version of this text exists, text mining techniques can't deal with the e-book formats (like .azw or .epub) used by Amazon or Google. In order to make Robinson's annotation readable by computers we would need to convert his text into programmable objects. One of the simplest ways to do this would be to create two lists (or *arrays* in programmer talk): one list that splits up the novel into stretches that are written by Mary and Percy respectively, and a second list with the author's names that correspond to those stretches of text. For example, the start of Chapter 14 (in the picture above) would be represented as follows:

__Table 1__: This how I wanted the annotated version of Frankenstein to be structured.

| Text Array | `nothing is more painful` | `than the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which,` | `when the mind ...` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Hand Array__ | `Mary Shelley` | `Percy Shelley` | `Mary Shelley` |

It might be possible to convert the e-book into this format. However, often e-books are DRM-protected which would probably make this process rather frustrating. Besides, it would probably be illegal to turn the e-book version into raw text and redistribute it online. Luckily, we have an alternative source for Robinson's annotated version: The Shelley Godwin Archive.

## The Shelley Godwin Archive

[The Shelley Godwin Archive](http://shelleygodwinarchive.org) (SGA) is a website that contains high quality scans and transcriptions of drafts written by different members of the Shelley and Godwin families. *Frankenstein* is one of the drafts presented on the website, and the description accompanying the draft states that:

> [b]oth our transcriptions of the Frankenstein Notebooks and our attribution of authorial hand are based on Charles E. Robinson’s magisterial edition, The Frankenstein Notebooks

The screenshot below illustrates how these transcriptions are presented:

![alt text](https://github.com/timjzee/frankenstein-v2/blob/master/articles/sga_interface.png?raw=true "SGA Interface")

In this interface, the transcriptions on the right provide a digitalized version of the draft page on the left, including the changes (in italics) made by Percy when he edited the draft. However, we can't really use these annotations as is. First of all, they're on a website, and second, although the changes by Percy are represented, it is not clear where they should be inserted. In other words, we need the source code of the transcriptions. The SGA actually allows you to see the code in which the transcriptions were made:

![alt text](https://github.com/timjzee/frankenstein-v2/blob/master/articles/sga_interface2.png?raw=true "SGA Interface")

But I needed these files locally, and luckily the SGA developers allow anyone to access them on [their GitHub page](https://github.com/umd-mith/sga). I now had a digital version of *Frankenstein* with Robinson's hand annotation, but no idea how to interpret them and turn them into the structure illustrated in Table 1.

## Parsing XML files

As a result of my (very limited) programming experience, I knew that the files I had downloaded were structured according to XML programming language and that this language made use hierarchical structures. But that was were my knowledge stopped. However, simply looking at an XML file can give you a good idea of what this all means. Let's take a look at a (slightly simplified version of) the xml code for the start of Chapter 14 (which corresponds to Chapter 13 in the draft):

```xml
<zone type="main">
  <line>Chap. 13<hi>th </hi></line>
  <line>Nothing is more painful
    <mod>
      <add hand="#pbs">than</add>
      <anchor xml:id="c56-0108.02"/>
    </mod> when the
  </line>
  <line>mind has been worked up by a <add>quick</add></line>
</zone>
```

The hierarchy in this structure can be visualized as follows:

### Hierarchical structure and recursive processing
Code example of recursive function:
- show that you need recursive function by first showing the problems that occur (with tail text specifically) when you 'flatten' hierarchical structure
### Encoding Guidelines
Looking back at this project/In hindsight, I was really lucky to have these encoding guidelines, especially considering my limited experience with xml. They essentially gave me a systematic and detailed overview of the problems that needed to be solved, allowing me to jump right into someone else's project.
