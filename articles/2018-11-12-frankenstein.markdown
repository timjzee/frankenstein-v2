# Introduction

In my [previous post](http://www.timzee.nl/linguistics/literature/text-mining/2018/05/21/frankenstein1.html), I described how I created hand annotation files for a draft version of Frankenstein. As I explained in that post, I needed those annotations as a baseline for an authorship attribution analysis of Frankenstein: Would such a machine learning approach come to similar conclusions as a painstaking handwriting analysis in terms of Percy Shelley's contribution to his wife's famous novel? This article will make a first attempt at answering that question. But first let's take a closer look at our hand annotation files and see how much and what Percy actually contributed.
